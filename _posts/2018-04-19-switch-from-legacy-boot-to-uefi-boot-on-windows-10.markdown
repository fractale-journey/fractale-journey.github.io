title: "Switch from legacy boot to uefi boot on Windows 10"
---

# Why switch?
UEFI bring GPT witch remove some limitation of the legacy boot system:
- It permit to have a lot of partition on the same drive.
- You can have partition bigger than 2 Terabytes.

# prerequisite
prepare an windows install media and a UBS stick.
We will need it latter to run commands when windows will not be bootable anymore.
Go to the windows website and burn it to the key.

# legacy table partition to gpt
install AOMEI partition assistant and transform your hard drive into GPT (no data lost).
now your pc canâ€™t boot anymore so we will work to change that.

# boot to the windows media key
and access to the console by clicking repair

# create a UEFI partition
for that use diskpart with the following constraints:
- partition of 500 MB in Fat32 in the first 2 Tera Bytes

# install windows boot loader in the UEFI partition
give letter to volume eufi and windows volume with diskpart
and run the folowing command:
``` powershell
bcdboot C:\windows /s G: /f UEFI
```
with C: the windows volume and G: the eufi volume

# done!
